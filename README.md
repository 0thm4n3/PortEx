PortEx
======

### Welcome to PortEx Beta

PortEx is a Java library for static malware analysis of Portable Executable files. Its focus is on PE malformation robustness, and anomaly detection. 
PortEx is written in Java and Scala, and targeted at Java applications.  
Visit the [PortEx project page](http://katjahahn.github.io/PortEx/).

### Features (so far)

* Reading header information from: MSDOS Header, COFF File Header, Optional Header, Section Table
* Reading standard section formats: Import Section, Resource Section, Export Section, Debug Section, Relocations
* Dumping of sections, overlay, embedded ZIP, JAR or .class files
* Scanning for file anomalies, including structural anomalies, deprecated, reserved, wrong or non-default values. The Beta1 release is able to detect 79 different anomalies. Click here for a full [list of anomalies](https://github.com/katjahahn/PortEx/blob/master/src/main/java/com/github/katjahahn/tools/anomalies/AnomalySubType.java)
* Visualize a PE file structure as it is on disk and visualize the local entropies of the file
* Calculate Shannon Entropy for files and sections
* Calculate hash values for files and sections
* Scan for PEiD signatures or your own signature database
* Scan for Jar to EXE wrapper (e.g. exe4j, jsmooth, jar2exe, launch4j)
* Extract Unicode and ASCII strings contained in the file
* Overlay detection and dumping
* Experimental: Detection Heuristics based on statistical information

### Version Information

The current version is in Beta, so beware of bugs and changes of the API until the first release.
The first release will be in December/January 2014.

### Using PortEx

#### Including PortEx to a Maven Project

PortEx will be added to the Central Maven Repository with its first release. Until then you can include PortEx as follows:

Download portex.pom and portex.jar and install portex to your local Maven repository as follows:

```
$ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=portex.jar -DpomFile=portex.pom
```

Now you can include PortEx to your project by adding the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
  		<groupId>portex</groupId>
  		<artifactId>portex_2.10</artifactId>
  		<version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Using the Fat Jar

Alternatively download portex.fat.jar and just include it to your build path.

For more information, read the [PortEx Wiki](https://github.com/katjahahn/PortEx/wiki)

### Building PortEx

#### Requirements

PortEx is build with [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org)  

#### Compile and Build With sbt

To simply compile the project invoke:

```
$ sbt compile
```

To create a jar: 

```
$ sbt package
```

For a fat jar (not recommended):

```
$ sbt assembly
```

#### Create Eclipse Project

You can create an eclipse project by using the sbteclipse plugin.
Add the following line to *project/plugins.sbt*:

```
addSbtPlugin("com.typesafe.sbteclipse" % "sbteclipse-plugin" % "2.4.0")
```

Generate the project files for Eclipse:

```
$ sbt eclipse
```

Import the project to Eclipse via the *Import Wizard*.
